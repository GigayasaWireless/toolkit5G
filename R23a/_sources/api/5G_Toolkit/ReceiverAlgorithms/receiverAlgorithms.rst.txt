Receiver Algorithms
===================

The 5G receiver design requires many algorithms to meet the different quality of service (QoS) metrics essential to
support a variety of use-cases supported by 5G. This section covers only the receiver algorithms required in lower
physical layer of 5G channels such as  time synchronization, frequency synchronization, channel estimation, and
equalization. The remaining algorithms such as symbol demapping, channel decoding, ToA estimation, DoA estimation etc.
are covered in the respective modules.

.. note::
    3rd Generation Partnership Project doesn't specify anything about how someone should design a receiver or receiver algorithms.
