Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH)
=======================================
5G-NR has designed 5 PUCCH formats for physical uplink control channel (PUCCH) to support diverse UCI payload lengths, reliability,
latency, and coverage requirements. These formats are classified into short PUCCH formats and long PUCCH formats as illustrated
in figure-[?]. The short format spans 1 or 2 OFDM symbols can be time multiplexed with uplink or downlink shared/data channels.
The short format can occupy last 1 or two symbols of a slot to facilitate quick reporting of HARQ acknowledgement. The short
formats are not suitable for coverage and large payloads. Hence, long PUCHH formats are designed which span 4 to 14 OFDM
symbols across 1 to 16 RBs and can carry both small and large payload sizes. Unlike small format where 12-24 length are
transmitted by UE and detected based on energy detection at the BS, the long formats are decoded based on the coherent detection
using demodulation reference signal (DMRS).
