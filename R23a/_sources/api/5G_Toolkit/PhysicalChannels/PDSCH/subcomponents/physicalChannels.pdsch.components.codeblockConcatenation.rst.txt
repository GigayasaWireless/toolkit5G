Code Block Concatenation
************************

Codeblock Concatenation: Transmitter
------------------------------------
Each codeblock is individually channel coded and broken further into 1 or 2 codeblock segments. All these codeblock
segments are concatenated by the last module of the upper physical layer chain. The implementation is compliant with
section 5.5 of [3GPPTS38212_LDPC]_. An example to demonstrate the implementation is shown below:

.. code-block:: python

   # rmBits ---> Rate Matched Output Block after Interleaving

   codeword   = CodeBlockConcatenation()(rmBits) #Performs Code Block Concatenation

The details of the API of **codeblock concatenation** is detailed below.

    :members:
    :exclude-members: call, build


Code-block Segregation: Receiver
--------------------------------
The block performs the opposite of code-block concatenation. It breaks the received codeword into multiple codeblock-segments
for rate matching.

Example, if number of groups in rate matching is 1

.. code-block:: python

   #numCBGrp1 ---> Number of Code Blocks in Group 1
   #numRMOP1  ---> Number of Rate Matched Output Bits of Group 1
   #codeword  ---> Demodulated Symbol Block

   cbSegregation  = CodeBlockSegregation(numCBGrp1, numRMOP1) #Performs Code Block Segregation
   cbSegregateLLR = cbSegregation(codeword)

Example, if number of groups in rate matching is 2

.. code-block:: python

   #numCBGrp1 ---> Number of Code Blocks in Group 1 as in bit selection of rate matching
   #numRMOP1  ---> Number of Rate Matched Output Bits of Group 1
   #numCBGrp2 ---> Number of Code Blocks in Group 2 as in bit selection of rate matching
   #numRMOP2  ---> Number of Rate Matched Output Bits of Group 2
   #codeword  ---> Demodulated Symbol Block

   cbSegregation  = CodeBlockSegregation(numCBGrp1, numRMOP1, numCBGrp2, numRMOP2) #Performs Code Block Segregation
   cbSegregateLLR = cbSegregation(codeword)
