Code Block Segmentation
***********************
Codeblock segmentation allows the physical layer to process large transport blocks to make the best use of the capabilities
of the encoder and decoders. To make the best use of the structure of the LDPC codes the inputs shall be passed in a certain
format with the bound on the upper limit of the inputs that LDPC codec can process. In case transport block sizes exceed
the upper limit, it is broken into multiple smaller sub-blocks called codeblocks which are individually processed by LDPC
encoder/decoder and ratemater/dematcher at transmitter and receiver respectively. The implementations are discussed in details
in upcoming sub-sections.


Codeblock Segmentation: Transmitter
------------------------------------
The codeblock segmentation breaks the large transport block into small codeblock which are processed individually a defined
in Section 5.3.2 of [3GPPTS38212_LDPC]_. The example demonstrate a way to use the ``CodeBlockSegmentation`` module.

.. code-block:: python

   coderate = 0.650390625 #Code Rate
   #crcTBlock ---> Transport Block with CRC bits attached

   cbSegment   = CodeBlockSegmentation(coderate) # Object for processing the code blocks
   codeblocks  = cbSegment(crcTBlock) # Attach the segment the TB and attach the CRC to TB based on 38.212


The API for codeblock segmentation is as follows.

.. autoclass:: toolkit5G.ChannelCoder.LDPC.CodeBlockSegmentation
    :members:
    :exclude-members: call, build

Code Block Aggregation: Receiver
--------------------------------
It performs opposite of code-block segmentation at the receiver to reconstruct the transport block to pass it for
transport block processing at receiver before forwarding to MAC layer. Example is understand the usage is shown below.

.. code-block:: python

   coderate = 0.650390625 #Code Rate
   #tbLen ---> Transport Block size
   #decBits ---> LDPC Decoded Block

   cbAggregate = CodeBlockAggregation(coderate, tbLen) #Object that performs Code Block Aggregation
   rTBwithCRC  = cbAggregate(decBits) #Output after Code Block Aggregation

The details of the API of **codeblock aggregation** is shown below:
