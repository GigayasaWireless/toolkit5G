Scrambling
==========
The scrambler is used in 5G to randomize the bits to remove the long consecutive occurrence of 1's and 0's. A scrambler
generates the random sequence which is xor-ed with information bit bit-wise. The scrambling is performed for two purposes:

    - Randomize the bit sequence or alter the probability distribution of the information bits.
    - Reduces impact of inter-cell interference by decorrelating the interference across neighbouring cells.

The scrambling is carried out for all the uplink abd downlink physical channel. For each channel, the seed used to generate
the scrambling sequence is different. The seed is computed using parameters relevant to a particular physical chain. The
details of the scrambling used in 5G is provided in table-1.

The receiver performs the inverse process of the scrambling called **de-scrambling**. Descrambling undo the affect of scrambling
to recover exact transmission bits. The details about the scrambling, descrambling and RNTI making is provided in upcoming
section.
