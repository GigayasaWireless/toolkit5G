Pseudo Random (PN) Sequence
===========================
The pseudo-random sequence is used for generating all the sequence used as reference signal in 5G. The 3GPP has defined
a sequence generation method ofr 5G in section 5.2.1 of [3GPPTS38211_PN]_ which uses two 31 length initial Gold sequences.
The first initialization sequence is fixed and second initialization sequence is generated using a seed (:math:`c_{init}`).
This seed allows the base-station (BS) and user equipment (UE) to reproduce the PN sequence exactly.

..  important::
    * The seed (:math:`c_{init}`) value is computed using an equation standardized by 3GPP for each reference signal.

**If** seed (:math:`c_{init}`) **is scalar:**

.. code-block:: Python

    c_init     = 25                  # seed value for generating the PN Sequence
    seqLength  = 120                 # Length of the PN Sequence
    pnObject   = PNSequence(c_init)  # Object for generating the PN sequence
    pnSequence = pnObject(seqLength) # Generate [1x120] pn sequence using pnObject

**If** seed (:math:`c_{init}`) **is NumPy Array:**

.. code-block:: Python

    c_init     = np.array([11,21359,2780]) # Cell ID-2 for SSS generation
    seqLength  = 161                       # Length of the PN Sequence
    pnObject   = PNSequence(c_init)        # Object for generating the PN sequence
    pnSequence = pnObject(seqLength)       # Generate [3x161] pss sequence using pnObject

The details about the input-output interface of the SSS implementation is provided below.
