Channel Interleaver for Polar Coder
===================================
Channel Interleaver is a low complexity version of Polar coded modulation (PCM). It improves the diversity gain for higher
modulation order. The downlink broadcast and control channels always use QPSK modulation order hence does not require
channel interleavers. It is an interleaver designed based on isoceles triangles whose sides are calculated based on the
number of the target bits.
