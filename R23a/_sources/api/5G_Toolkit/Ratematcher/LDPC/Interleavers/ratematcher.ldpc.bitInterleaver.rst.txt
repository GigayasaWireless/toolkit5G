Bit Interleaver for LDPC
========================
The bit interleaver is used in LDPC to minimize the damage caused by frequency selective channels to LDPC codes's error
correction capability. LDPC codes perform poorly for burst errors. The bit interleaver distribute the localized erroneous
bits across the length of the block which results in improved performance.


.. note::
    Bit interleaver improves the LDPC performance against burst and symbols errors.
