Channel Interleaver
===================
The channel interleaver is used by rate matcher of Polar codec after bit Selection. Its a triangular interleaver which
creates a isosceles triangular buffer and insert data into this buffer row-wise and reads it column wise. This interleaver
is include in 5G only for uplink channels to improve the performance of Polar codes for higher order QAM constellations.

.. Important::
    Channel Interleaver improves the coding performance of Polar codec for higher order QAM constellation in uplink..


.. Note::
    In 5G, Channel Interleaver is used in uplink (PUSCH and PUCCH) only.
