ToA Least Square Estimate
=========================
This module estimates the position of the target node using time of arrival (ToA) measurements based on the least square
framework. The implementation of ToA based least square estimator is inspired from [hppInF]_.


------------

An example to estimate the position based on the ToA measurement is given in following code-block.

.. code-block:: Python

    positionEstimator = LeastSquareToA()
    # Position Estimation Object:
        # Positioning based on: ToA
        # Optimization Method: Least Square

    # Shape of txPosition: (Nref,3)
    # Shape of ToAe: (Nref,)

    locEstimate, posError = positionEstimator(txPosition, ToAe)

The details of the input output interface to use this module is provided in following sub-section.
