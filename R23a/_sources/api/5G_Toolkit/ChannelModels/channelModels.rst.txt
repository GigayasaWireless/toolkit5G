Channel Models
===============

This is the module which provides functions and classes that implement channel modeling compliant with 3GPP.

Channel modeling correrspond to five important sub modules namely :ref:`Antenna-Array`, :ref:`Node-Mobility`,
:ref:`Simulation-Layout`, :ref:`Channel-Parameter-Generator` and :ref:`Channel-Coefficient-Generator`
The class :class:`AntennaArrays` implements the antenna array both at the transmitter and receiver side.
:class:`NodeMobility` allows the users to simulate the channel across multiple snapshots. i.e., It provides the flexibility to simulate the channel
considering the mobility of nodes at both ends of the link. 
The class :class:`SimulationLayout` implements the deployment of Base Stations (BS's) and dropping User Equipments (UE's) inside a particular geometry.
:class:`ParameterGenearator` class provides all the parameters necessary to simulate channel coefficients, that includes Large Scale Parameters (LSP's) like
Delay Spread, Angular Spreads both in azimuth and zenith directions, Path Loss etc., Small Scale Parameters (SSP's) like 
cluster delays, cluster powers, cluster angular spreads and cluster/ray angles (both arrival, departure in azimuth, zenith directions).
The class :class:`CoefficientGenearator` implements the cluster level channel coefficients for each link generated in the simulation. 


The implementation of antenna element corresponding to class :class:`AntennaArrays` can be found from the module :ref:`Antenna-Elements`.
The class :class:`Antenna_3GPP_38901` implements 3GPP 38.901 antenna element.
The class :class:`Antenna_HertzianDipole` implements Hertzina Dipole antenna and 
the class :class:`Antenna_LinearDipole` implements Linear Dipole antenna.

BS layout implementation and the UE drop implementation can be found from the modules :ref:`BS-Layouts` and :ref:`UE-Drops` respectively.
