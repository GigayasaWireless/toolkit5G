# Detailed Installation on Ubuntu

## Update Ubuntu system

Lets start by updating the system:
~~~
sudo apt-get update
~~~

## Install Python

Those who don't have Python on their system can install by running the following command (The ones who use conda 
environment can skip this and install python directly using conda environment as described in upcoming subsection).
~~~
sudo apt-get install pythonX.Y
~~~

For example Python 3.11 can be installed directly using the following command:
~~~
sudo apt-get install python3.11
~~~

The installation status can be confirmed with following commands:
~~~
python3 --version
~~~

or

~~~
python --version
~~~
It shall return the version of python installed using the above command.

## Install PIP

PIP is automatically installed by python package, you can check the version of PIP to confirm the installation
~~~
pip --version
~~~

In case above command doesn't produce expected output, please install PIP using following command:
~~~
sudo apt install python3-pip
~~~


## Install Miniconda

If Anaconda is already installed on your system, then you can skip this step. The following instructions install the 
Miniconda which is a lighter version of Anaconda. First we will download miniconda using the command:
~~~
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
~~~

Followed by, installing miniconda using the downloaded package.
~~~
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
~~~

Once the installation is completed, we can check the version installed Conda on our system:
~~~
conda --v
~~~

Now, we will use conda to create a new environment for python 3.11 (this command will automatically install python 3.11 
in the target environment):
~~~
conda create -n myenv python==3.11
~~~

Finally, we will activate the created environment by executing
~~~
conda activate myenv
~~~

We will install everything from further now in this environment only.

## Install Jupyter Notebook

Install Jupyter for interactive scripting in Python.
~~~
pip install Jupyter
~~~

## Install 5G Toolkit

Finally, we are ready to install 5G Toolkit:

The **template command** for installation is given below:
![](_static/Install_Toolkit.png)

**For Python 3.7**:

~~~
pip install --no-cache-dir https://github.com/GigayasaWireless/toolkit5G/raw/R23a.0.10/package/python3_7/toolkit5G-0.10-py3-none-any.whl
~~~

**For Python 3.8**:

~~~
pip install --no-cache-dir https://github.com/GigayasaWireless/toolkit5G/raw/R23a.0.10/package/python3_8/toolkit5G-0.10-py3-none-any.whl
~~~

**For Python 3.9**:

~~~
pip install --no-cache-dir https://github.com/GigayasaWireless/toolkit5G/raw/R23a.0.10/package/python3_9/toolkit5G-0.10-py3-none-any.whl
~~~

**For Python 3.10**:

~~~
pip install --no-cache-dir https://github.com/GigayasaWireless/toolkit5G/raw/R23a.0.10/package/python3_10/toolkit5G-0.10-py3-none-any.whl
~~~

**For Python 3.11**:

~~~
pip install --no-cache-dir https://github.com/GigayasaWireless/toolkit5G/raw/R23a.0.10/package/python3_11/toolkit5G-0.10-py3-none-any.whl
~~~

Once the installation is complete the user can verify the installation by the output of the pip show command:

~~~
pip show toolkit5G
~~~

## Final Confirmation

open Jupyter Notebook
~~~
jupyter notebook
~~~

Create a new jupyter notebook and run the following lines of code:

~~~
import toolkit5G as tk
tk.__version__
~~~
The toolkit is successfully installed if it shows the toolkit5G version. Otherwise, something went wrong. If it shows 
"License Error", then you will have to activate the License as described on [installation page](install.md#activate-the-5g-toolkit-license).

# Detailed Installation on Windows 10/11

## Install Python
To be updated!

## Install PIP
To be updated!

When the installation is complete, verify the installation by checking the pip version:
~~~
pip --version
~~~

## Install Miniconda
To be updated!

Once the installation is completed, we can check the version installed Conda on our system:
~~~
conda --v
~~~

Now, we will use conda to create a new environment for python 3.11 (this command will automatically install python 3.11 
in the target environment):
~~~
conda create -n myenv python==3.11
~~~

Finally, we will activate the created environment by executing
~~~
conda activate myenv
~~~

We will install everything from further now in this environment only.
