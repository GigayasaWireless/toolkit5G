# Detailed Installation on Ubuntu

## Update Ubuntu system

Lets start by updating the system:
~~~
sudo apt-get update
~~~

## Install Miniconda

If Anaconda is already installed on your system, then you can skip this step. The following instructions install the 
Miniconda which is a lighter version of Anaconda. First we will download miniconda using the command:

**Please install the latest version of the Miniconda. Following version might be outdated**
~~~
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
~~~

Followed by, installing miniconda using the downloaded package.
~~~
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
~~~

Once the installation is completed, we can check the version installed Conda on our system:
~~~
conda --v
~~~

Now, we will use conda to create a new environment for python 3.11 (this command will automatically install python 3.11 
in the target environment):
~~~
conda create -n gigayasa python==3.11
~~~

Finally, we will activate the created environment by executing
~~~
conda activate gigayasa
~~~

We will install everything from further now in this environment only.

## Install Jupyter Notebook

Install Jupyter for interactive scripting in Python.
~~~
pip install Jupyter
~~~

## Install 5G Toolkit

Finally, we are ready to install 5G Toolkit:

The **template command** for installation is given below:
![](_static/Install_Toolkit.png)

**For Python 3.7**:

~~~
pip install --no-cache-dir https://github.com/GigayasaWireless/toolkit5G/raw/R23a.0.11/package/python3_7/toolkit5G-0.11-py3-none-any.whl
~~~

**For Python 3.8**:

~~~
pip install --no-cache-dir https://github.com/GigayasaWireless/toolkit5G/raw/R23a.0.11/package/python3_8/toolkit5G-0.11-py3-none-any.whl
~~~

**For Python 3.9**:

~~~
pip install --no-cache-dir https://github.com/GigayasaWireless/toolkit5G/raw/R23a.0.11/package/python3_9/toolkit5G-0.11-py3-none-any.whl
~~~

**For Python 3.10**:

~~~
pip install --no-cache-dir https://github.com/GigayasaWireless/toolkit5G/raw/R23a.0.11/package/python3_10/toolkit5G-0.11-py3-none-any.whl
~~~

**For Python 3.11**:

~~~
pip install --no-cache-dir https://github.com/GigayasaWireless/toolkit5G/raw/R23a.0.11/package/python3_11/toolkit5G-0.11-py3-none-any.whl
~~~

To confirm installation of the library, you can check the installation library:
~~~
pip show toolkit5G
~~~

## Final Confirmation

The installation will be truly successful if we are able to import the toolkit5G packages. We can verify it using 
**Jupyter Notebook**, open the jupyter notebook using following command in your browser.
~~~
jupyter notebook
~~~

Create a new jupyter notebook and run the following lines of code:

~~~
import toolkit5G as tk
tk.__version__
~~~

The same procedure is followed in this video.

The toolkit is successfully installed if it shows the toolkit5G version. Otherwise, something went wrong. If it shows 
"License Error", then you will have to activate the License as described on [installation page](install.md#activate-the-5g-toolkit-license).
But still if you are struggling please email us at any of the following emails:
* toolkit5g@gigayasa.com
* support@gigayasa.com
* vikram@gigayasa.com

We will be more than happy to help you in installation.

# Detailed Installation on Windows 10/11

## Install Miniconda

1. Download the Miniconda installer from this link:
 **Please install the latest version of the installer from this [link](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). Following link might be outdated**

   * For 32 bit version of Windows: [Download Miniconda Installer](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86.exe)
   * For 64 bit version of Windows: [Download Miniconda Installer](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe)

2. Install **Miniconda** by executing this installer.

## Create an environment using Conda

Click on start button and find Anaconda Prompt.

Once the installation is completed, we can check the Conda version installed on our system:
~~~
conda --v
~~~

Now, we will use conda to create a new environment for python 3.11 (this command will automatically install python 3.11 
in the target environment):
~~~
conda create -n myenv python==3.11
~~~

Finally, we will activate the created environment by executing
~~~
conda activate myenv
~~~

We will install everything from further now in this environment only.

## Install Jupyter Notebook

Install Jupyter for interactive scripting in Python.
~~~
pip install Jupyter
~~~

## Install 5G Toolkit

Finally, we are ready to install 5G Toolkit:

The **template command** for installation is given below:

**For Python 3.7**:

<p class="callout warning"> <strong>Note</strong>: Initial version of Python 3.7 is buggy. Hence, only Python>=3.7.4 is supported. </p>

~~~
pip install --no-cache-dir https://github.com/GigayasaWireless/toolkit5G/raw/R23a.0.11/package/python3_7/toolkit5G-0.11-py3-none-any.whl
~~~

~~~

Once the installation is complete the user can verify the installation by the output of the pip show command:

~~~
pip show toolkit5G
~~~

## Final Confirmation

open Jupyter Notebook
~~~
jupyter notebook
