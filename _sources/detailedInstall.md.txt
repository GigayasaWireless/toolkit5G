# Detailed Installation on Ubuntu

## Update Ubuntu system

The complete process starts with an Ubuntu update
~~~
sudo apt-get update
~~~

## Install Python

Those who don't have Python on their system can install by running the following command.
~~~
sudo apt-get install pythonX.Y
~~~

For version 3.11 of Python, you can run the following:
~~~
sudo apt-get install python3.11
~~~

The installation status can be confirmed with following commands:
~~~
python3 --version
~~~

or

~~~
python --version
~~~

## Install PIP

Now, we need to install package manager for installing any package/library for Python. 
~~~
sudo apt install python3-pip
~~~

When the installation is complete, verify the installation by checking the pip version:
~~~
pip --version
~~~

## Install Miniconda

If Anaconda is already installed on your system, then you can skip this step. The following instructions install the 
Miniconda which is a lighter version of Anaconda. First we will download miniconda using the command:
~~~
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
~~~

Followed by, installing miniconda using the downloaded package.
~~~
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
~~~

Once the installation is completed, we can check the version installed Conda on our system:
~~~
conda --v
~~~

Now, we will use conda to create a new environment for python 3.11:
~~~
conda create -n myenv python==3.11
~~~

Finally, we will activate the created environment by executing
~~~
conda activate myenv
~~~

We will install everything from further now in this environment.

## Install Jupyter Notebook

We will install Jupyter for interactive scripting in Python.
~~~
pip install Jupyter
~~~

## Install 5G Toolkit

Finally, we are ready to install 5G Toolkit:

The **template command** for installation is given below:

**For Python 3.7**:

~~~
pip install --no-cache-dir https://github.com/GigayasaWireless/toolkit5G/raw/R23a.0.10/package/python3_7/toolkit5G-0.10-py3-none-any.whl
~~~

**For Python 3.8**:

~~~
pip install --no-cache-dir https://github.com/GigayasaWireless/toolkit5G/raw/R23a.0.10/package/python3_8/toolkit5G-0.10-py3-none-any.whl
~~~

**For Python 3.9**:

~~~
pip install --no-cache-dir https://github.com/GigayasaWireless/toolkit5G/raw/R23a.0.10/package/python3_9/toolkit5G-0.10-py3-none-any.whl
~~~

**For Python 3.10**:

~~~
pip install --no-cache-dir https://github.com/GigayasaWireless/toolkit5G/raw/R23a.0.10/package/python3_10/toolkit5G-0.10-py3-none-any.whl
~~~

**For Python 3.11**:

~~~
pip install --no-cache-dir https://github.com/GigayasaWireless/toolkit5G/raw/R23a.0.10/package/python3_11/toolkit5G-0.10-py3-none-any.whl
~~~


Once the installation is complete the user can verify the installation by the output of the pip show command:
~~~
pip show toolkit5G
~~~

## Final Confirmation

open Jupyter Notebook
~~~
jupyter notebook
~~~


Create a new script and run "import toolkit5G as tk" in one of the cell. If it imports successfully, the package has been
installed. If it shows "License Error", then you will have to activate the License as described on [installation page](install.md#activate-the-5g-toolkit-license).

~~~
import toolkit5G as tk
tk.__version__
~~~
