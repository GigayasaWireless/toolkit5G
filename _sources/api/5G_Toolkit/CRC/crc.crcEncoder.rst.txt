CRC Encoder
===========
CRC Encoder attaches the parity bits to inputs sequence based on the crc polynomial configured. It supports all the CRC
polynomials standardized by 3GPP for 5G. It supports the CRC polynomial "CRC24A", "CRC24B", "CRC24C", "CRC16", "CRC11",
and "CRC6". The details of these polynomial are provided in Section 5.1 of [3GPPTS38211_crc]_. CRC Encoder uses `Sionna CRC Encoder <https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/mapping.html#demapping>`_
internally. The has been design to pass input exactly same as `Sionna CRC Encoder <https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/mapping.html#demapping>`_
for compatibility.

..  important::
    * CRC Encoder doesn't support 1D arrays as inputs. The arrays of dimension (N,) can be passed by reshaping it to (1,N).

The CRC encoding is performed as follows:

**CRC Encoding for 1D NumPy Arrays**

.. code-block:: Python

    bits       = np.random.randint(0, 2, size = (1,32)) # Bits to be Encoded
    crcType    = "CRC24C"
    crcEncoder = CRCEncoder(crcType) # Create object of CRC Encoder
    crcBits    = crcEncoder(bits)    # Encode the bits (attach the CRC at the end)
    ## Shape of crcBits will be (1, 56)


**CRC Encoding for 2D NumPy Arrays**

.. code-block:: Python

    bits       = np.random.randint(0, 2, size = (21,64)) # Bits to be Encoded
    crcType    = "CRC16"
    crcBits    = CRCEncoder(crcType)(bits)    # Encode the bits (attach the CRC at the end)
    ## Shape of crcBits will be (21, 80)

**CRC Encoding for Higher dimension NumPy Arrays**

.. code-block:: Python

    bits       = np.random.randint(0, 2, size = (8,6,119)) # Bits to be Encoded
    crcType    = "CRC6"
    crcBits    = CRCEncoder(crcType)(bits)    # Encode the bits (attach the CRC at the end)
    ## Shape of crcBits will be (8,6,125)
