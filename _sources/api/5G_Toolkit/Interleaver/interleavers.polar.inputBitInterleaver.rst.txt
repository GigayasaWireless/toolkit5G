Input Bit Interleaver
=====================
The input bit interleaver is used by all the downlink chains using **polar codes** chain before CRC encoder. It helps in
reducing the complexity of the receiver by early termination. This interleaver places the parity bits immediately after
the information bits which enables the receiver to sequentially check the parity bits without waiting to buffer the complete
information block.

.. Important::
    Input Bit Interleaver reduces the complexity, improves false alarm rate and reduces decoding delays of a 5G user equipment.


.. Note::
    In 5G, Input Bit Interleaver is used in downlink (PBCH and PDCCH) only.
