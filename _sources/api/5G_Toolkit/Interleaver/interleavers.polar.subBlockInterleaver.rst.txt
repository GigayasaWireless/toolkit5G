Sub Block Interleaver
=====================
The sub-block interleaver rearranges the sub-blocks of the polar encoded codewords. The block fading is very common in wireless
communication which can severely corrupt a sub-block of data. The performance of many channel codes is sensitive to block
errors. To handle such scenarios, 5G uses sub-block interleaver which helps in spreading such errors across the complete
codeword length. This makes the polar codes more robust to burst errors. Such interleaver has been used in 4G and other
wireless standards as well.

.. Important::
    Sub-block interleaving improves the robustness of the polar codes against the burst errors.

.. Note::
    Length of vector passes to **sub-block interleaver** must be multiple of 32.
