RNTI Masking
============
RNTI masking is used in PDCCH chain to scramble the crc bits using radio network temporary identifier. The RNTI masking
allows the UE to identify whether the data is intended for unicast, multicast or broadcast. Furthermore if the data is unicast,
it allows the UE to distinguish between different DCI formats which are carrying the same payload size but are intended
for different purpose. The implementation details of rnti masking is provided in section 7.3.2 of [3GPPTS38212_rnti]_.

..  important::
    * RNTI masking is inverse process. The same module can be used for masking and unmasking both.

The following example demonstrate the usage of the

**RNTI Masking**

.. code-block:: Python

    K       = 56    # Number of DCI bits
    dciBits = np.random.randint(0, 2, size = K) # Generates DCI bits
    rnti    = 11548                      # RNTI for masking the bits
    dciRNTI = RNTImasking(rnti)(dciBits) # Performing DCI masking

**Removing the RNTI mask**

.. code-block:: Python

    decBits = RNTImasking(rnti)(dciRNTI) # Removing DCI mask

The details about the input-output interface of the RNTI masking is provided below.
