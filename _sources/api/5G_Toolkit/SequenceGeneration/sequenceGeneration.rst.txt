Sequence Generation
===================
The sequence generation (package) provides modules for generating all the reference signal standardized by 3GPP for 5G NR
systems. The reference signal (RS) and their utilities for downlink and uplink provided respectively in table1 and table2.

These reference signals are used for various purposes such as link adaptation, rank adaptation, initial access, synchronization,
precoding, data decoding and position estimation etc. in uplink and downlink. The reference signal supported by 5G toolkit
are explained in detailed in following sections. The packages generates these 3GPP compliant reference signals in for link
level and system level simulations. Moreover, these reference signal can be directly mapped to OFDM resource grid and used
for transmission over wireless channel for simulation using [??].

.. [*] These features will be released in upcoming versions.
