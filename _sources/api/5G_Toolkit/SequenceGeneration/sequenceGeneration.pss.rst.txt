Primary Synchronization Signal
##############################
Primary synchronization signal (PSS) is a m-sequence of length 127 generated using :math:`N_{ID}^2`. It is used for time
synchronization which aims to find the slot boundary by the user equipment (UE). The :math:`N_{ID}^2` provides a cyclic
shift to a base sequence as defined in [3GPPTS38211_PSS]_.

..  important::
    * PSS is an constituent of synchronization signal block (SSB). It is loaded in the middle (across frequency) of first symbol of the SSB.

The primary synchronization signal is generated as follows:

**If** :math:`N_{ID}^2` **is scalar:**

.. code-block:: Python

    nID2        = 1         # Cell ID-2 for PSS generation
    pss         = PSS(nID2) # Generate PSS object using this cell ID-2.
    pssSequence = pss()     # Generate [1x127] pss sequence using 'pss' object

**If** :math:`N_{ID}^2` **is NumPy array:**

.. code-block:: Python

    nID2        = np.array([1,0,2,1]) # Cell ID-2 for PSS generation
    pss         = PSS(nID2)           # Generate PSS object using this cell ID-2.
    pssSequence = pss()               # Generate [4x127] pss sequence using 'pss' object for each cell-ID2

The details about the input-output interface of the PSS implementation is provided below.
