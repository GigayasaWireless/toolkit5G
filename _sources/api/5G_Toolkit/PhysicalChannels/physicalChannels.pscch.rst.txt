Physical Sidelink Control Channel (PSCCH)
======================================
This module implements the physical Sidelink control channel.The complete physical layer chain at the transmitter and
receiver is divided into upper physical layer chain (upperPhy) and lower physical layer chain (lowerPhy).The upper
physical layer consists of 24 Bit CRC addition, Polar Encoding and, rate matching.On the other hand, the lower physical
layer module implements scrambling, modulation (symbol mapping),and resource mapping. It return the OFDM resource grid
for sub-carrier/sub-band specific precoding/beamforming and other RF specific processing. These modules provides the high
level APIs for the PDSCH chains.

PSCCH Transmitter
*****************
The details about the transmitter side of the PDSCH are provided in [3GPPTS38211pscch]_, [3GPPTS38212pscch]_ and
[COMST.2021.3057017]_. The chain is bi-parted into upper physical layer and lower physical layer section to entertain
both the link-level and system level simulations. The details of the APIs is provided in following sub-sections.
