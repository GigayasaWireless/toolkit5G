PUCCH: Upper Physical Layer Chain
**********************************

The procedures for upper physical layer processing for PUCCH Format 2,3,4 are similar

This module implements the receiver chain of upper physical layer processing involving the following algorithms based on transmitter algorithms as described in Section 6.3 of [3GPPTS38212_pucch]_ and Section 6.3.2 of [3GPPTS38211_pucch]_. The UCI Block to be processed is generated based on the payload size and number of user equipments.
    
    * Symbol De-Mapping
        
        The symbol estimates are demodulated based on the modulation order as described in Sections 6.3.2.5.2 of [3GPPTS38211_pucch_format2] and 6.3.2.6.2 of [3GPPTS38211_pucch_formats3and4]
        
    * De-Scrambling
    
        The Log Likelihood Ratios are descrambled based on the concept specified in Sections of 6.3.2.5.1 [3GPPTS38211_pucch_format2] and 6.3.2.6.1 of [3GPPTS38211_pucch_formats3and4]
        
    * Code Block Segregation | Opposite to Code Block Concatenation
    
        The descrambled data is then segregated into number of code blocks based on the concept specified in Section 6.3.1.5 of [3GPPTS38212_pucch].
        
    * De-Rate Matching
    
        The segregated code blocks are then de-rate matched based on the concept as specified in Section 6.3.1.4 of [3GPPTS38212_pucch]. 
        
    * Channel De-Coder
    
        The De-Rate matched code blocks are then decoded as described in Sectio 6.3.1.3 of [3GPPTS38212_pucch].
        
    * Code Block Aggregation | Opposite to Code Block Segmentation
    
        The decoded code blocks are then aggregated also involving CRC detachment. 
        
Example: UCI sequence block is not inputted and for format 4

.. code-block:: python

   snr            = 100000      # SNR
   modOrder       = 2           # Modulation Order
   formatPUCCH    = 'Format 4'  # PUCCH Format
   rnti           = 45976       # Radio network Temporary Identifier
   nID            = 545         # Data Scrambling Identity
   numInfoBits    = 1654        # Payload size (Number of Information bits)
   numOfSegments  = 2           # Number of code blocks
   E              = 1792        # Rate matching output sequence length
   N              = 1024        # Number of channel coded bits
   K              = 838         # Bumber of bits to be coded (After Segmentation)
	   
   Equalized_Symbols ---> Equalized Symbols 
   
   pucchUpperPHYDecoder_Obj = PUCCHUpperPHYDecoder(snr, modOrder, formatPUCCH, rnti, nID, numOfSegments, numInfoBits, E, N, K) # Object performing PUCCH Upper physical layer chain for format 2,3,4
   pucchUpperPHYDecoder     = pucchUpperPHYDecoder_Obj(Equalized_Symbols) # Returns the Transmitted UCI Block and its CRC check

Example: UCI sequence block is inputted and for format 2

.. code-block:: python

   snr            = 100000      # SNR
	 modOrder       = 2           # Modulation Order
	 formatPUCCH    = 'Format 2'  # PUCCH Format
	 rnti           = 10779       # Radio network Temporary Identifier
	 nID            = 377         # Data Scrambling Identity
	 numInfoBits    = 40          # Payload size (Number of Information bits)
	 numOfSegments  = 1           # Number of code blocks
	 E              = 8192        # Rate matching output sequence length
	 N              = 512        # Number of channel coded bits
	 K              = 51         # Bumber of bits to be coded (After Segmentation)
   
   Equalized_Symbols ---> Equalized Symbols 
   
   pucchUpperPHYDecoder_Obj = PUCCHUpperPHYDecoder(snr, modOrder, formatPUCCH, rnti, nID, numOfSegments, numInfoBits, E, N, K) # Object performing PUCCH Upper physical layer chain for format 2,3,4
   pucchUpperPHYDecoder     = pucchUpperPHYDecoder_Obj(Equalized_Symbols) # Returns the Transmitted UCI Block and its CRC check
