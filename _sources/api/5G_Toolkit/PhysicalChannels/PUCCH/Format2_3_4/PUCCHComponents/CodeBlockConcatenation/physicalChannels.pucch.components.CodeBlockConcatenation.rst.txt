Code Block Concatenation
************************

Code Block Concatenation: Transmitter
--------------------------------------
Each codeblock is individually channel coded and broken further into 1 or 2 codeblock segments. All these codeblock
segments are concatenated by the last module of the upper physical layer chain. The implementation is compliant with
section 5.5 of [3GPPTS38212]_. An example to demonstrate the implementation is shown below:

Example: 

.. code-block:: python

   numBatches = 5    # Number of user equipments
   numCBs     = 2    # Number of code blocks
   #bit generation
   bits = np.random.randint(2, size = (numBatches, numCBs, 200))

   numTargetBits  = 4224  # Number of target bits 
   
   cbConcatenated = CodeBlockConcatenation(numTargetBits)(bits) # Returns the concatenated code blocks

The details of the API of **codeblock concatenation** is detailed below.

.. autoclass:: toolkit5G.ChannelCoder.PolarCoder.CodeBlockConcatenation
    :members:
    :exclude-members: call, build


Code Block Segregation: Receiver
--------------------------------

The block performs the opposite of code-block concatenation. It breaks the received codeword into multiple codeblock-segments
for rate matching.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

   numInfoBits   = 1555  # Payload size (Number of Information bits)
   numOfSegments = 2     # Number of codeblocks
   E             = 2112  # Rate matching output sequence length
   
   #bit generation
   bits = np.random.randint(2, size = (numBatches, 4224))

	 
   codewordSegregation = CodeBlockSegregation(numInfoBits)(bits, E, numOfSegments) # Returns the code blocks


The details of the input output interface of **codeblock segregation** is shown below:
