PDSCH Chain
=============
This involves the processesing of data in the Physical Downlink Shared Channel. The Physical layer processes either I or 2 Transport Blocks for each resource allocation. In the downlink direction, a maximum of 8 layers can be generated for MIMO. A single Transport Block is processed if 1 to 4 layers are allocated, whereas two Transport Blocks are processed if 5 to 8 layers are allocated. This describes the Physical layer processing for the PDSCH in two parts
