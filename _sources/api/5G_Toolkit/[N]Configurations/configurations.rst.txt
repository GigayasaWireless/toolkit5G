5G Configurations
==================
5G physical layer implementation is controlled by radio resource controller and MAC scheduler using various RRC and non-
RRC parameters which influences the 5G network performance. These parameters can be very large in number and overwhelming
for the users select and pass for simulations. Hence, 5G-Toolkit provides configuration APIs to generate a valid set of
parameters for simulating the relevant chains and procedures. The users can pass the parameters of their interest and the
APIs select/returns the remaining parameters from a valid set of configurations which complies with 5G standards.

.. important::
    Current, version of toolkit-5G provides configurations for following chains and reference signals:
        - Channel state information reference signals (CSI-RS).
        - Sounding reference signal (SRS).
        - Time frequency configurations which covers parameters related to:
            - Frame structure,
            - Numerology and bandwidth,
            - Sampling rate and OFDM.
        - SSB/PBCH
        - Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) and DMRS-PDSCH.
            - Separately for upper physical layer and lower physical layer chains.

.. note::
    The un-configured parameters are selected randomly from a valid set of possible values.
