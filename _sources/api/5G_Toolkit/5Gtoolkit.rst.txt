API Documentation
=================
5G Toolkit supports wide range of procedures, usecases and features. Some of them are captured directly via the APIs as
discussed below in table-1.

   * - Module/Package
     - Purpose
   * - Sequence Generation
     - Generate all the sequences used for wide variety of purposes in 5G such as channel state acquisition, positioning etc.
   * - Resource Mapping
     - This modules maps various sequences and physical channels payload to the time frequency OFDM grid/resources.
   * - Physical Channels
     - Implements uplink and downlink control, shared and broadcast/random channels.
   * - Payload Generation
     - Generate MIB and DCI payloads,
   * - Forward Error Correction
     - Implements Polar codec, LDPC Codec and Reed Muller Codec for 5G.
   * - Rate matching
     - Supports rate matching for Polar codec, LDPC Codec and Reed Muller Codec.
   * - Interleavers
     - Presents all the Interleavers/Deinterleavers available for various chains in 5G.
   * - OFDM
     - Implements Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing modulator and demodulator.
   * - Channel processing
     - Provides packages for passing a Transmitted signal though the channel in time/frequency domain and adding noise to the input signal based on the SNR.
   * - Symbol Mapping
     - Supports the symbol mapping and symbol demapping to convert the bits to symbols and recovering the llrs/bits from symbols.
   * - Scrambling
     - Implements 5G complaint scrambler and descrambler to randomize the input bits and undo this randomization at receiver.
   * - CRC
     - Implements Cyclic redundancy check encoder and decoder for all the generator polynomial supported by 5G.
   * - Positioning
     - Provides algorithms for delay estimation and position estimation using delay estimates.
