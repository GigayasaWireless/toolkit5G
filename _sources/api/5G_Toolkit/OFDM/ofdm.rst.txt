Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
==========================================
5G air interface is designed based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). OFDM simplifies the transmitter
and receiver design for broadband communication which is characterised by frequency selective channels. Furthermore, it
facilitates easy time and frequency division multiplexing. The details about the modulation and demodulation is provided
in upcoming sections.

.. Warning::
    Current implementation of OFDM assume that the cyclic prefix for OFDM is same for all the OFDM symbols. In 5G, the
    cyclic prefix size varies for different OFDM symbols.
