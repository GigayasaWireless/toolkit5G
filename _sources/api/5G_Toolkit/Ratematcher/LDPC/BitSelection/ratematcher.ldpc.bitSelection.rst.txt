Bit Selection for LDPC
======================
Bit Selection is used to match the encoded bits to target bits using the circular buffer. The target bits is a reflection
of the number of time-frequency resources allocated for payload transmission. Bit Selection performs one of the three
operations based on the number of information bits, number of target bits and number of coded bits:

* Truncation (N>E)
* Puncturing (N>E)
* Repetition (N<E)

The rate matching is carried out using on a match pattern. The number of rate matched bits are reduced in the case of
truncation and puncturing which perform similar function but differ only in the rate match pattern.

.. note::
    Truncation selects first E bits whereas puncturing selects E bits starting from a certain defined location.

.. note::
    Puncturing rate match patterns enables the hybrid repeat request (HARQ) via incremental redundancy technique.
