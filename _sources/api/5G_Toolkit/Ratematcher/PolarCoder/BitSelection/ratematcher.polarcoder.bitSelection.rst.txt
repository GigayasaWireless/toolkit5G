Bit Selection for Polar Coder
=============================
Bit Selection is used to match the encoded bits to target bits using the circular buffer. The target bits is a reflection
of the number of time-frequency resource allocated for payload transmission. Bit Selection performs one of the three
operations based on the number of information bits, number of target bits and number of encoded bits:

* Truncation (N>E)
* Puncturing (N>E)
* Repetition (N<E)

The rate matching pattern is carried out based on a match pattern. The number of rate matched bits are reduced in the
case of first two with the only different being the rate match pattern.

.. note::
    Truncation selects first E bits whereas puncturing selects E bits starting from a certain location.
