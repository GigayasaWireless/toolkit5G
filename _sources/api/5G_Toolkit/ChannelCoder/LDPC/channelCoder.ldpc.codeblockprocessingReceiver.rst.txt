Codeblock Processing: Receiver
===============================
These module are implemented at the receiver to complement the procedure of codeblock processing at the transmitter.

Code-block Segregation
**********************
The block performs the opposite of code-block concatenation. It breaks the received codeword into multiple codeblock-segments
for rate matching.

Example, if number of groups in rate matching is 1

.. code-block:: python

   #numCBGrp1 ---> Number of Code Blocks in Group 1
   #numRMOP1  ---> Number of Rate Matched Output Bits of Group 1
   #codeword  ---> Demodulated Symbol Block

   cbSegregation  = CodeBlockSegregation(numCBGrp1, numRMOP1) #Performs Code Block Segregation
   cbSegregateLLR = cbSegregation(codeword)

Example, if number of groups in rate matching is 2

.. code-block:: python

   #numCBGrp1 ---> Number of Code Blocks in Group 1 as in bit selection of rate matching
   #numRMOP1  ---> Number of Rate Matched Output Bits of Group 1
   #numCBGrp2 ---> Number of Code Blocks in Group 2 as in bit selection of rate matching
   #numRMOP2  ---> Number of Rate Matched Output Bits of Group 2
   #codeword  ---> Demodulated Symbol Block

   cbSegregation  = CodeBlockSegregation(numCBGrp1, numRMOP1, numCBGrp2, numRMOP2) #Performs Code Block Segregation
   cbSegregateLLR = cbSegregation(codeword)

Codeblock Aggregation
*********************
It performs opposite of code-block segmentation at the receiver to reconstruct the transport block to pass it for
transport block processing at receiver before forwarding to MAC layer. Example is understand the usage is shown below.

.. code-block:: python

   coderate = 0.650390625 #Code Rate
   #tbLen ---> Transport Block size
   #decBits ---> LDPC Decoded Block

   cbAggregate = CodeBlockAggregation(coderate, tbLen) #Object that performs Code Block Aggregation
   rTBwithCRC = cbAggregate(decBits) #Output after Code Block Aggregation

The details of the API of **codeblock aggregation** is shown below:
