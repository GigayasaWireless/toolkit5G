Channel Models
===============

This is the module which provides functions and classes that implement channel models compliant with 3GPP 38.901.

Channel modeling correspond to five important sub modules namely :ref:`Antenna-Array`, :ref:`Node-Mobility`,
:ref:`Simulation-Layout`, :ref:`Channel-Parameter-Generator` and :ref:`Channel-Generator`. 


- The class :class:`AntennaArrays` implements the antenna array both at the transmitter and receiver side.

- The :class:`NodeMobility` allows the users to simulate the channel across multiple snapshots. i.e., It provides the flexibility to simulate the channel.
  considering the mobility of nodes at both ends of the link. 

- The class :class:`SimulationLayout` implements the deployment of Base Stations (BS's) and dropping User Equipments (UE's) inside a particular geometry.

- The :class:`ParameterGenearator` provides all the parameters necessary to simulate channel coefficients, that includes both Large Scale Parameters (LSP's) and Small Scale Parameters (SSP's).

   - LSPs include Delay Spread, Angular Spreads both in azimuth and zenith directions, Path Loss etc.,

   - SSPs include cluster delays, cluster powers, cluster angular spreads and cluster/ray angles (both arrival, departure in azimuth, zenith directions).
  
- The :class:`ChannelGenearator` generate the cluster level channel coefficients both in time and frequency domain.  


The implementation of antenna elements corresponding to the class :class:`AntennaArrays` can be found from the module :ref:`Antenna-Elements`.

   - The class :class:`Antenna_3GPP_38901` implements 3GPP 38.901 parabolic antenna element.
   - The class :class:`Antenna_HertzianDipole` implements Hertzina Dipole antenna. 
   - The class :class:`Antenna_LinearDipole` implements Linear Dipole antenna.

BS layout and the UE drop implementation can be found from the modules :ref:`BS-Layouts` and :ref:`UE-Drops` respectively.
