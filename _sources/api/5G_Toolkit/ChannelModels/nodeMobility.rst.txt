.. _Node-Mobility:

Node Mobility
=============


This module provides classes and the functions that implements Node Mobility.
The class :class:`NodeMobility` implement the mobility of each node in the simulation.

.. _Mobility-Models:

Mobility Models
---------------

This module provides classes and functions that implement different types of mobility models to support node mobility.
Current implementation support three mobility models namely Random-Walk , Circular and Highway drops.
Classes :class:`RandomWalk` implement Random-Walk, :class:`CircularRoute` implement Circular route and :class:`DropVehiclesHighway` implements vehicle drops
in highway respectively.

.. _CircularRoute:

Circular Route
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autoclass:: toolkit5G.ChannelModels.nodeMobility.CircularRoute

.. _VehicleHighwayDrops:

Vehicle Drops on HighWays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
   All the classes have the following attributes :attr:`nodeRoute`, :attr:`velocityVector` from which the user can access the
   route and the velocity of each node respectively.
