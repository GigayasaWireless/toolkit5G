Mobility Models
===============

This module provides classes and functions that implement different types of mobility models to support node mobility. 
Current implementation support three mobility models namely Random-Walk , Circular and Highway drops.
Classes :class:`RandomWalk` implement Random-Walk, :class:`CircularRoute` implement Circular route and :class:`DropVehiclesHighway` implements vehicle drops 
in highway respectively.




.. _RandomWalk:

Random-Walk
-----------
 
.. autoclass:: toolkit5G.channelModels.nodeMobility.MobilityModels.RandomWalk
   :members:
   :exclude-members: call, build



.. _CircularRoute: 

Circular Route
--------------     
   
.. autoclass:: toolkit5G.channelModels.nodeMobility.MobilityModels.CircularRoute
   :members:
   :exclude-members: call, build 
   


.. _VehicleHighwayDrops:
    
Vehicle Drops on HighWays
-------------------------  
 
.. autoclass:: toolkit5G.channelModels.nodeMobility.MobilityModels.DropVehiclesHighway
   :members:
   :exclude-members: call, build       



.. note::
   All the classes have the following attributes :attr:`nodeRoute`, :attr:`velocityVector` from which the user can access the
   route and the velocity of each node respectively.
