DFT based Method
================
This module implements a method for estimating the delays using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) method. This method
uses the discrete Fourier transform to compute the power delay profile (PDP) and estimates delays by finding the spikes
the PDP. It can also the Fourier oversampling to up sample the time domain channel to further improve the resolution of
ToA estimates, However, this method suffers performance degradation if channel state information (CSI) is not available
across all the sub-carriers which is very common in practical scenarios.

**Code example**

.. code-block:: Python

    # shape of Hf: (numSubcarriers, numObservations)
    osFactor   = 16
    Lpath      = 12
    dftToA     = DFT_ToA(osFactor)
    delays     = dftToA(H, Lpath, scs, prominence=0.05, height=0.05)


.. code-block:: Python

    fig, ax = dftToA.displayPDPs(delays[0]*0.25, delays[-1]*1.25)
