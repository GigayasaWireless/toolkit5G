Gradient Descent for TDoA
=========================
The :math:`\text{4G}^\text{th}` and :math:`\text{5G}^\text{th}` generation of wireless networks uses time difference of arrival
methods to estimate the position of node. The nomenclature of the methods is detailed below. The implementation of
Newton Raphson and Gradient Descent optimization methods is inspired from [handbookTDoA]_.

In 5G, the ToA estimates suffers from calibration impairments and antenna to base-band delays which propagates in-accuracies
in the position estimates. However, the TDoA measurements are computed by taking difference of all ToA measurements with respect to
one reference ToA measurement which can cancel the fixed receiver antenna to base-band delay across all the measurements.
This makes TDoA measurements more robust to these impairments in comparison to ToA measurements.
The major challenges with TDoA based positioning are two.

- No close-form optimization method for estimating the nodes location.
    - High complexity.

- In case reference ToA measurement is NLoS, positioning accuracy degrades significantly.

Hence, TDoA based positioning methods rely on iterative optimization methods. One such optimization method is **Gradient
Descent** (GD) which has low complexity iteration in comparison to **Newton Raphson** (NR) method but needs more iterations to
converge to local/global optima. The comparison between the two methods is shown below:

The following code illustrate the way to compute the time difference of arrival (TDoA) using time of arrival (ToA). The
TDoA/RSTD measurement is passed to Newton Raphson optimization method to estimate the user equipment (UE) location.

**Code example**

.. code-block:: Python

    positionEstimate = GradientDescentTDoA(numIterations = 100000, numRepetition = 10,
                                         tolerance = 0.0000000001, stepsize = 0.1)
    # Position Estimation Object:
        # Positioning based on: TDoA
        # Optimization Method: Gradient Descent
    tdoa = ToAe[1::] - ToAe[0] # Time difference of arrival/RSTD
    rxPositionEstimate = positionEstimate(txPosition, tdoa) # Position estimation using TDoA/RSTD

The input output interface for usage of Gradient Descent algorithm is provided below.

The following code snippet illustrate the way to compute the time difference of arrival (TDoA) using time of arrival
