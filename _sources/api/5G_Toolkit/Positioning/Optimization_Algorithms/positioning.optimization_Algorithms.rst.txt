Optimization Algorithms
=======================
The optimization algorithm are used to estimate the location of a node using the measurements. The measurements can be
based on time (:math:`\in \{` ToA, TDoA, RTT :math:`\}`), angle (:math:`\in \{` AoA, AoD :math:`\}`) or received power
(RSRP). Different optimization framework can be used for estimating the location. 5G toolkit provides least square,
Gradient descent and Newton Raphson based algorithms which are discussed below.
