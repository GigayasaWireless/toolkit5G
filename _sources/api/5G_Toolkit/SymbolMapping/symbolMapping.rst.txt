Symbol Mapping
==============
The symbol mapper is used to map multiple bits on-to symbol based on "QAM" or "PSK" mapping. These symbols are processed
by lower physical layer for transmission over the wireless channel. At receiver, the log likelihood ratios or the hard bits
can be recovered from the estimated symbols using the symbol demapper.
