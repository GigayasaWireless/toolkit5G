Search Space Set
================
The modules provides the classes and functions that implement Search Space Set.

Search Space is defined as the predefined region in which UE perform the blind decoding.
In the PDCCH region in DL radio frame, there can be many places where a specific PDCCH is located and UE searches all the possible locations.
The possible location for a PDCCH differs depending on whether the PDCCH is Common or UE-specific, and also depend on what aggregation level is used.
Set of all the possible location for PDCCH is called *Search Space Set* and  each of the possible location is called a *PDCCH Candidate*.
The search space indicates the set of CCE locations where the UE may find its PDCCHs.

There are two types of search space : the common search space and the UE-specific search space.
A UE is required to monitor both common and UE-specific search space.

The common search space would carry the DCIs that are common for all UEs. For example, system information (using the SI-RNTI), paging (P-RNTI), PRACH responses (RA-RNTI),
or UL TPC commands (TPC-PUCCH/PUSCH-RNTI).
The UE monitors the common search space using aggregation level 4 and 8.
Maximum number of CCEs present in common search space is 16.

The UE-specific search space can carry DCIs for UE-specific allocations using the UE's assigned C-RNTI.
The UE monitors the UE-specific search space at all aggregation levels {1, 2, 4, and 8}.

An example of CORESET is given below. After instatiation of the class :class:`SearchSpaceSet`, user can fetch the PDCCH monitoring slots and monitoring symbols with in a slot.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: Python

   # numerology
   >>> mu = 0
   # Number of Slots Per Radio Frame for a choosen numerology.
   >>> numOfSlotsPerFramePerNumerology  = (2**mu)*10
   # Type of search space set choosen. Here we choose Common Search Space or "CSS"
   >>> ssType = "CSS"
   # Aggregation Level 
   >>> AL = 4
   # duration of CORSET in number of symbols
   >> coresetDuration = 2
   # REG bundle Size
   #########################################
   # PDCCH monitoring periodicity : ks slots 
   #########################################
   >>> ks = 20
   ####################################
   # PDCCH monitoring offset : os slots
   ####################################
   >> os = 0
   ############################################################################################
   # duration of search space set in  terms of number of slots : Ts slots and Ts<=ks for ks>=2
   ############################################################################################
   >> Ts = 3
   # Instanstiating SearchSpaceSet object with above choosen parameters.
   >>> sssObj = SearchSpaceSet(mu,ssType)
   >>> sssObj(ks,os,Ts,AL,coresetDuration) 
   # PDCCH monitoring slots                 
   >>> sssObj.pdcchMonitoringSlotIndices
   # PDCCH Monitoring Symbols With in a slot
   >>> sssObj.pdcchMonitoringSymbolsWithinSlot
