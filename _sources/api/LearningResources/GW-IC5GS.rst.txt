Introductory Course on 5G Standards
====================================
This course introduces the audience to the basic framework of the 5G physical layer standards and the most important
elements of 5G user equipment (UE) and 5G base-station (BS). The following is the typical content taught in introductory
5G standards course.

1. 3D spatial channel model
2. Frame structure and OFDM resource grids
3. Channel codes
4. Air Interface of 5G
    - Interleavers,
    - Scramblers,
    - Cyclic Redundancy Check,
    - Channel Codes,
    - Rate matching,
    - Symbol Mapping,
    - MIMO,
    - OFDM.
5. Reference Signals
    - Demodulation Reference Signals
    - Synchronization Signals,
    - Reference Signals for Channel Sounding: CSI-RS | SRS.
    - Position Reference Signal.
    - Low PAPR sequence Type-I/II.
    - Remote Interference Management Reference Signal.
    - Phase Tracking Reference Signal.
6. Physical Channels
    - Broadcast Channel (PBCH).
    - Random Access Channel (PRACH).
    - Shared Channel: PDSCH | PUSCH.
    - Control Channel: PDCCH | PUCCH.
