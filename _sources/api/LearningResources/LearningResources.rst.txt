Learning Resources
==================
We are developing following courses which can be will help the audience understand how to the 5G Toolkit.

Introductory Course on 5G Standards
************************************
This course introduces the audience to the basic framework of the 5G physical layer standards and the most important
elements of 5G user equipment (UE) and 5G base-station (BS). The following is the typical content taught in introductory
5G standards course.

1. 3D spatial channel model
2. Frame structure and OFDM resource grids
3. Channel codes
4. Air Interface of 5G
    - Interleavers,
    - Scramblers,
    - Cyclic Redundancy Check,
    - Channel Codes,
    - Rate matching,
    - Symbol Mapping,
    - MIMO,
    - OFDM.
5. Reference Signals
    - Demodulation Reference Signals
    - Synchronization Signals,
    - Reference Signals for Channel Sounding: CSI-RS | SRS.
    - Position Reference Signal.
    - Low PAPR sequence Type-I/II.
    - Remote Interference Management Reference Signal.
    - Phase Tracking Reference Signal.
6. Physical Channels
    - Broadcast Channel (PBCH).
    - Random Access Channel (PRACH).
    - Shared Channel: PDSCH | PUSCH.
    - Control Channel: PDCCH | PUCCH.


Hardware Emulations using 5G Toolkit and SDRs
**********************************************
This course will introduce the audience to some practical aspects related to 5G systems using the 5G toolkit and software
defined radios (SDRs). We will be using ADALM-Pluto SDR primarily due to the availability, cost effectiveness and ease of
use. However, the course can be experienced using any other SDR available with you as long as it supports the Python APIs.
These APIs will be used for passing the I/Q samples of 5G signals and information generated using 5G -Toolkit to radio
unit of the SDRs for analog processing followed by transmission of processed signal over the wireless channel using antennas.
