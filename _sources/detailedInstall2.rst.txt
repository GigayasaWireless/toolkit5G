Install 5G Toolkit
==================

This page takes the user through the complete process of installing all the packages to the point where they can use the
5G toolkit easily in a Jupyter Notebook.

Detailed Installation on Ubuntu
===============================

Update Ubuntu system
--------------------

Lets start by updating the system:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get update


Install Miniconda
------------------

If Anaconda is already installed on your system, then you can skip this step. The following instructions install the 
Miniconda which is a lighter version of Anaconda. First we will download miniconda using the command:

.. note::

    Please install the latest version of the Miniconda. Following version might be outdated

.. code-block:: bash

    wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

Followed by, installing miniconda using the downloaded package.

.. code-block:: bash

    bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh


Once the installation is completed, we can check the version installed Conda on our system:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda --v

------------

Now, we will use conda to create a new environment for python 3.11 (this command will automatically install python 3.11 
in the target environment):

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n gigayasa python==3.11


Finally, we will activate the created environment by executing

.. code-block:: bash

    conda activate gigayasa


We will install everything from further now in this environment only.

Install Jupyter Notebook
-------------------------

Install Jupyter for interactive scripting in Python.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install Jupyter


Install 5G Toolkit
------------------

Finally, we are ready to install 5G Toolkit:

The **template command** for installation is given below:

.. image:: _static/Install_Toolkit.png

**For Python 3.7**:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --no-cache-dir https://github.com/GigayasaWireless/toolkit5G/raw/R23a.0.11/package/python3_7/toolkit5G-0.10-py3-none-any.whl


**For Python 3.8**:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --no-cache-dir https://github.com/GigayasaWireless/toolkit5G/raw/R23a.0.11/package/python3_8/toolkit5G-0.10-py3-none-any.whl


**For Python 3.9**:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --no-cache-dir https://github.com/GigayasaWireless/toolkit5G/raw/R23a.0.11/package/python3_9/toolkit5G-0.10-py3-none-any.whl


**For Python 3.10**:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --no-cache-dir https://github.com/GigayasaWireless/toolkit5G/raw/R23a.0.11/package/python3_10/toolkit5G-0.10-py3-none-any.whl


**For Python 3.11**:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --no-cache-dir https://github.com/GigayasaWireless/toolkit5G/raw/R23a.0.11/package/python3_11/toolkit5G-0.10-py3-none-any.whl


To confirm installation of the library, you can check the installation library:

.. code-block:: bash
    pip show toolkit5G


Final Confirmation
-------------------

The installation will be truly successful if we are able to import the toolkit5G packages. We can verify it using 
**Jupyter Notebook**, open the jupyter notebook using following command in your browser.

.. code-block:: bash
    jupyter notebook


Create a new jupyter notebook and run the following lines of code:

.. code-block:: ipython3

    import toolkit5G as tk
    tk.__version__

------------------

The toolkit is successfully installed if it shows the toolkit5G version. Otherwise, something went wrong. If it shows 
"License Error", then you will have to activate the License as described on [installation page](install.md#activate-the-5g-toolkit-license).
But still if you are struggling please email us at any of the following emails:

#. `<toolkit5g@gigayasa.com>`_
#. `<support@gigayasa.com>`_
#. `<vikram@gigayasa.com>`_

We will be more than happy to help you in installation.

Detailed Installation on Windows 10/11
--------------------------------------

Install Miniconda
-----------------

1. Download the Miniconda installer from this link:
 **Please install the latest version of the installer from this link https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html. Following link might be outdated**

   * For 32 bit version of Windows: `Download Miniconda Installer <https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86.exe>`_
   * For 64 bit version of Windows: `Download Miniconda Installer <https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe>`_

2. Install **Miniconda** by executing this installer.

Create an environment using Conda
---------------------------------

Click on start button and find Anaconda Prompt.

Once the installation is completed, we can check the Conda version installed on our system:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda --v


Now, we will use conda to create a new environment for python 3.11 (this command will automatically install python 3.11 in the target environment):

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n myenv python==3.11


Finally, we will activate the created environment by executing

.. code-block:: bash

    conda activate myenv


We will install everything from further now in this environment only.
