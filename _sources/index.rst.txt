5G Toolkit
======================================
.. include:: <isonum.txt>

`5G-Toolkit <https://gigayasa.com/>`_\ |trade| provides a rich library of functions and modules in
`Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ based on `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_ to design algorithms for 5G and Beyond
wireless systems. It implements `3GPP <https://www.3gpp.org/>`_ standards complaint downlink and uplink chains to
perform multi-cell link level and system level simulations. It support variety of realistic antenna models, simulation
models and channels to facilitates the users to carry out standards-based research, development and testing. It provides
modules which are highly optimized for performance to reduce the prototyping time which further scales with GPUs and
TPUs. It internally uses many modules provided by `Sionna <https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/#sionna/>`_. The library
provide interactive interfaces to analyze the performance of the methods and develop better understanding of the
systems. It is designed to work well with CPUs, GPUs and TPUs.

How the documentation is organized
###################################

|5G Toolkit| documentation provides a detailed understanding of the product. A high-level overview of the complete
toolkit is given below. It will enable you to locate the things they might be looking for:

* :doc:`Part 1: About <about>` discusses the installation process and the other libraries required to install the product.

* :doc:`Part 2: API Documentation <api/5G_Toolkit/5Gtoolkit>` provides the details of the input-output interface of all the modules along with examples demonstrating their usage.

* :doc:`Part 3: Tutorials <api/Tutorials/Tutorials>` guides you to use the toolkit using a set of simple well illustrated tutorials. These tutorials cover Channel codes, physical chains and wireless channels. More tutorials will be added along the way.

* :doc:`Part 4: Projects <api/Projects/Projects>` are the guides and lay out the recipes to solve some complex challenging problems using the toolkit. It provided the codes to implement some of the state of the art research work (paper) using the modules of the toolkit.

* :doc:`Part 5: Tentative list of features <api/Preview_of_Next_Release/FeatureList>` arrange the list of features that will be released in upcoming quarters.

* :doc:`Part 6: Research work carried out using 5G Toolkit <api/Built_using_5G_Toolkit/builtUsing5GToolkit>` list down the work that used **5G Toolkit**.

* :doc:`Part 7: Challenge of this week <api/WeekChallenge/challenge>` is an initiative by `Gigayasa <https://gigayasa.com/>`_ to excite young researchers to about wireless communication. The board will float a research problem every month and interested researchers can solve the problem using 5G Toolkit and share the code repository with us on |Contact|. The best responses will be rewarded. We will provide the solution of each problem at the end of the month.

* :doc:`Part 8: Licenses <api/License/license>` describes the license and copyright related to 5G Toolkit.
